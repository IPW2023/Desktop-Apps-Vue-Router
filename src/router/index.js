 * Every route is an object containing a path, usually '/route-name' and a component, the name of the component.
 * Example: { path: '/new-route', component: NewRoute }

 * 
 * Warning: you have to also include history: createWebHistory() as a parameter to createRouter, in the same object ({}) as the routes
